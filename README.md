# utm-plugin
Standalone UTM sessionization and tracking plugin

Simple Javascript plugin for detecting UTM parameters in a URL, saving them to the user's session, and using those UTM values throughout the user's lifecycle.

This plugin has functions for autofilling the UTM values to hidden form fields, but you can access and use the user's saved values in any way you need, such as gating content.

code example:
```javascript
	var searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search); //store as var

	if(searchParams.has('sent')){} //true/false
```

UTM Parameter example:
```
https://website.com?utm_source=test&utm_medium=test&utm_campaign=test&utm_term=test&utm_content=test
```

UTM parameters supported:
- utm_source
- utm_medium
- utm_campaign
- utm_term
- utm_content
- utm_state

**Experimental** - utm_state: this variable shows the current state of the UTM parameters, and can have 3 possible values that denote the user's behavior in relation to the UTMs.

This field can be used for basic attribution - if the value is "localStorage", that means the user has left the site and come back to it later.   

Note that this UTM field is non-standard, and therefore will not be picked up automatically by standard analytics.  It must be manually correlated by the analytics expert.

- "url" - The UTM params are present in the URL.  Lasts until the user navigates to a new page.
- "sessionStorage" - The UTM params are present in the user's session.  Lasts until the user closes the tab they're in.
- "localStorage" - The UTM params are present in the user's long-term cookie storage.  Lasts until the user clears their browser cache.
